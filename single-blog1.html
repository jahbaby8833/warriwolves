                           <h3>Brazilian Football Legend Pele is Dead</h3>
                           <p>Pelé, the Brazilian soccer legend who won three World Cups and became the sport's first global icon, has died at the age of 82.
                              “Everything that we are, is thanks to you,” his daughter Kely Nascimento wrote in a post on Instagram, under an image of family 
                              members holding Pele's hands. “We love you infinitely. Rest in peace.” Pelé was admitted to a hospital in São Paulo in late 
                              November for a respiratory infection and for complications related to colon cancer. Last week, the hospital said his health had 
                              worsened as his cancer progressed. He died on Thursday from multiple organ failure due to the progression of colon cancer, 
                              according to a statement from Albert Einstein Hospital. For more than 60 years, the name Pelé has been synonymous with soccer. 
                              He played in four World Cups and is the only player in history to win three, but his legacy stretched far beyond his trophy haul 
                              and remarkable goal-scoring record. “I was born to play football, just like Beethoven was born to write music and Michelangelo 
                              was born to paint,” Pelé famously said. Tributes have been pouring in for the soccer legend.
                           </p>
                           <h3>The man Pele</h3>
                           <p>Pelé's first club, Santos FC, responded to the news on Twitter with the words “eternal” shared next to an image of a crown.
                              Brazilian footballer Neymar said Pelé “changed everything.” In a post on Instagram, he wrote: “He turned football into art, into 
                              entertainment. He gave a voice to the poor, to black people and especially: He gave visibility to Brazil. Football and Brazil 
                              have raised their status thanks to the King!” he added. Portuguese star forward Cristiano Ronaldo sent his condolences to Brazil 
                              in a post on Instagram, saying “a mere “goodbye” to the eternal King Pelé will never be enough to express the pain that currently 
                              engulfs the entire football world.” Kylian Mbappé of Paris Saint-Germain said of Pelé's death: “The king of football has left us 
                              but his legacy will never be forgotten.” Former English soccer player Geoff Hurst wrote on Twitter of his memories of Pelé, calling 
                              the late star “without doubt the best footballer I ever played against (with Bobby Moore being the best footballer I ever played 
                              alongside). For me Pele remains the greatest of all time and I was proud to be on the the pitch with him. RIP Pele and thank you.”
                              Brazi's incoming President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took to Twitter to pay his respects to Pelé, saying “few Brazilians took the 
                              name of our country as far as he did.” “As different from Portuguese as the language was, foreigners from the four corners of the 
                              planet soon found a way to pronounce the magic word: 'Pelé,’” Lula added. A public wake will be held for Pelé on Monday at the 
                              Urbano Caldeira stadium, popularly known as Vila Belmiro and home to Santos football club, in Brazil's São Paulo state, according 
                              to a Thursday statement from Santos FC. At dawn Monday, Pele's body will be moved from the Albert Einstein Hospital to the stadium. 
                              The soccer legend's coffin will be placed in the center of the pitch.
                           </p>
                           <p>The wake at Vila Belmiro will continue until Tuesday 10 a.m. local time (8 a.m. ET), after which a funeral procession will carry 
                              Pelé's coffin through the streets of the city of Santos, including the street where Pelé's 100-year-old mother, Celeste Arantes, 
                              lives. The cortege will continue to Pelé's final resting place, the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica cemetery in Santos, where a private 
                              funeral, reserved for family members, will be held.

                              <h3> Dazzling ability</h3>

                              Pelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in Três Corações - an inland city roughly 155 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro - in 1940, 
                              before his family moved to the city of Bauru in São Paulo. The genesis of the nickname Pelé are unclear, even to the footballer. 
                              He once wrote in the British newspaper The Guardian that it likely started with school classmates teasing him for mangling the 
                              nickname of another player, Bilé. Whatever the origin, the moniker stuck. As a child, his first taste of soccer involved playing 
                              barefoot with socks and rags rolled up into a ball - a humble beginning that would grow into a long and fruitful career. But when he 
                              first took up the game, his ambitions were modest. “My dad was a good football player, he scored a lot of goals,” Pelé told CNN in 2015. 
                              “His name was Dondinho; I wanted to be like him. “He was famous in Brazil, in Minas Gerais. He was my role model. I always wanted to be 
                              like him, but what happened, to this day, only God can explain.” As a teenager, Pelé left home and began training with Santos, scoring 
                              his first goal for the club side before his 16th birthday. He would go on to score 619 times over 638 appearances for the club, but 
                              it is his feats in the iconic yellow jersey of Brazil for which he is best remembered. The world first got a glimpse of Pelé's dazzling 
                              ability in 1958, when he made his World Cup debut aged 17. He scored Brazil's only goal in the country's quarterfinal victory against 
                              Wales, then netted a hat-trick in the semifinal against France and two in the final against host Sweden. “When Pelé scored the fifth goal 
                              in that final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding,” said Sweden's Sigvard Parling. For Pelé, the standout memory from the 
                              tournament was putting his country on the sporting map. “When we won the World Cup, everybody knew about Brazil,” he told CNN's Don Riddell 
                              in 2016. “I think this was the most important thing I gave to my country because we were well known after that World Cup.” Another World Cup 
                              victory came in 1962, although an injury sidelined Pelé for the tournament's later stages. Further injuries hampered his next campaign in 1966 
                              as Brazil exited the competition after the group stage, but redemption came in 1970. “Pelé was saying that we were going to win, and if Pelé 
                              was saying that, then we were going to win the World Cup,” Brazil's co-captain Carlos Alberto said about the tournament. That team - featuring 
                              the likes of Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostão, Rivellino, and, of course, Pelé - is regarded as one of the greatest ever assembled. In the final - a 4-1 
                              victory against Italy - Brazil scored arguably the most famous World Cup goal of all time, a sweeping, length-of-the-pitch move involving nine of 
                              the team's 10 outfield players. It ended with Pelé teeing up Alberto, who drilled the ball into the bottom corner of the net. Brazil's mantra of 
                              jogo bonito (the beautiful game) has never been better encapsulated. Pelé, who had considered retiring before the 1970 World Cup, scored a goal 
                              of his own in the final and a total of four over the course of the tournament. “Before the match, I told myself that Pelé was just flesh and bones 
                              like the rest of us,” Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich said after his side's defeat in the final. “Later, I realized I'd been wrong.” The 
                              tournament capped Pelé's World Cup career but not his time in the spotlight. In 1975, he signed a $1.67-million-a-year contract in the United 
                              States with the New York Cosmos.

                              <h3>One of the greatest players</h3>
                              
                              With his larger-than-life personality and extraordinary dribbling skills - a trademark of his game - Pele's helped the Cosmos win the North American 
                              Soccer League championship in 1977 before officially retiring from football. The league, which attracted further big names like Giorgio Chinaglia and 
                              Franz Beckenbauer, wouldn't last, ultimately folding in 1984. But around the world, Pelé's influence endured. He remained in the public eye through 
                              endorsement deals and as an outspoken political voice who championed the poor in Brazil. He served as a Goodwill UNICEF ambassador for many years, 
                              promoting peace and support for vulnerable children. Health problems persisted for much of Pelé's later life. He got around with the support of a 
                              walker - an item he was filmed shoving around with disdain in a documentary released last year - and in September 2021, he underwent surgery to 
                              remove a tumor from his right colon. Pelé's cancer treatment continued over the past year. He was hospitalized in Sao Paulo in November as the 
                              2022 World Cup was being played in Qatar, prompting an outpouring of support from the global soccer community and beyond. Debate will inevitably 
                              rage about whether Pelé is the greatest player of all time - whether it is possible to compare Pelé’s achievements to those of Cristiano Ronaldo or 
                              Lionel Messi, who have rewritten soccer's record books over the past 15 years, or to Diego Maradona, the late Argentinian star who captivated the 
                              footballing world in the 1980s and 90s. In 2000, FIFA jointly named Maradona and Pelé as Player of the Century, but to some, the outright winner 
                              of the award should have been obvious. “This debate about the player of the century is absurd,” said Zico, who represented Brazil in the decade 
                              after Pelé’s retirement. “There’s only one possible answer: Pelé. He’s the greatest player of all time, and by some distance, I might add.”
                              Exactly how many goals Pelé scored during his career is unclear, and his Guinness World Records tally has come under scrutiny with many scored 
                              in unofficial matches. In March 2021, he congratulated Portugal’s Ronaldo for passing his “record of goals in official matches” – 767. There is 
                              little doubt, however, that Pelé was, and always will be, football’s first global superstar. “If I pass away one day, I am happy because I tried 
                              to do my best,” he told The Talks online magazine. “My sport allowed me to do so much because it’s the biggest sport in the world.”
